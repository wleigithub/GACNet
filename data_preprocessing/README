First, compile the c++ and cuda code for data preprocess using commands
    cd eig_compution_op 
    sh cmake.sh
    cd ..
* You may need [PCL](http://www.pointclouds.org/) to compile.


Then, modify the data path and prepare the training and testing data on S3DIS with commands
    cd prep_stanford
    python gen_indoor3d_h5.py
    python prep_scene.py
